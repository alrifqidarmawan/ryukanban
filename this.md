Of course. This is the best part. You've successfully read data from your database and displayed it. Now, you need to be able to write data back to it.

The most logical next step for a Kanban board is creating a new task.

Let's not even think about code yet. Let's think about the user experience and the flow of data. I'm going to ask you a series of questions. Answering them is your next task.

Your Mission: Think Through "Create a Task"
Part 1: The User Interface (The "View")

Where should the user even begin? If you look at your board, where would you expect to find a button or a link to add a new task? Should there be one big "Add Task" button at the top of the whole board? Or should each column have its own "Add a card..." button at the bottom? What are the pros and cons of each approach?

What happens after the user clicks "Add"? Do they get a popup window (a modal)? Does a little form appear right inside the column? Let's start with the simplest option: a form appears.

What does that form need? For a simple task, what is the absolute minimum piece of information you need from the user? (Hint: look at your TaskCard component). You'll definitely need an <input> field for that and a "Save" button.

How do you manage what the user is typing? In React, when you have a form input, how do you keep track of its value? Which hook is used to manage state that can change over time?

Part 2: The Data Logic (The "Model")

The user clicks "Save". Now what? You have the text from the input field (managed by the hook from the previous question). What do you need to do with this text?

What does a complete Task object look like? Remind yourself of the structure. It probably has an id, a title, and a status.

You get the title from the form input.

If you're adding a task to the "To Do" column, what should its status be?

What about the id? Should the user type that in? Or should the database handle that for us? (Hint: Think back to how we defined the stores in Dexie. What did ++id mean?).

How do you talk to the database? You have your db object that you imported from @/lib/db. You've already read from it with db.tasks.toArray(). It seems logical that Dexie would provide a simple way to add to it. What would you guess that method is called? Something like db.tasks.create(...) or db.tasks.add(...)? (A quick look at the Dexie.js documentation for "add" or "create" items would confirm this for you).

Part 3: The Magic Moment (The "Controller" logic meets the "View")

This is the most important question.

Once your "Save" button's function successfully calls db.tasks.add(...) and adds the new task object to the database... what do you think will happen on the screen? And why will it happen?

Take your time and think through these questions. Write down your answers. Sketch out what the new component (AddTaskForm perhaps?) might look like. When you have a clear idea of the plan, you're ready to write the code.

You've got this. Show me your plan.
